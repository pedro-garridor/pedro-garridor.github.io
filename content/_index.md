Hi, welcome to my homepage!

My name is Pedro. I'm a bioinformatician and researcher with experience in hematology, oncology and rare diseases, as well as human genetics using both long and short reads. This webpage is an overview of my work as researcher and developer, so feel free to take a look around in the [about me](about) section and on the top menu :)
