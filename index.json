CALR ins5-mediated clonal hematopoiesis causes severe hemolytic anemia in a female PGK1 Ser320Asn carrier. Blood Cancer Journal, 15(1), 8.\nDOI: 10.1038/s41408-025-01216-w\nHereditary hemolytic anemias (HHA) are rare inherited red blood cell (RBC) disorders caused by genetic abnormalities (hemoglobino/membrano/enzymopathies), characterized by anemia due to premature RBC destruction and intrinsic RBC defects. One of the rarer enzymopathies involves a deficiency in phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), an X-linked gene critical for ATP production via glycolysis. PGK1 mutations causing deficiency (OMIM#300653) follow an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern, affecting hemizygous males, while female carriers are generally asymptomatic or may have mild symptoms -consistent with mosaicism for PGK1 activity-.\nDespite PGK1 is ubiquitously expressed, its deficiency mainly affects the blood, central nervous system (CNS), and skeletal muscle, resulting in chronic hemolysis -with or without anemia-, neurological disorders, or myopathies. Likely explained by the causative PGK1 mutation, hemolytic anemias (HA) tends to co-occur with CNS defects, whereas myopathies are almost exclusively observed.\nTo date, approximately 40 patients harboring 30 different mutations have been reported. This report presents the first case of severe HA in a female PGK1 mutation heterozygous carrier, which became apparent coinciding with the diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia (ET); and elucidates the mechanism by which a clonal disorder transforms a germline recessive disease into a tissue-specific dominant condition.\n","date":"1 February 2025","permalink":"/publications/2025-02-01/","section":"Publications","summary":"","title":"CALRins5-mediated clonal hematopoiesis causes severe hemolytic anemia in a female PGK1Ser320Asn carrier"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/paper/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Paper"},{"content":"You can find the papers I\u0026rsquo;ve (co)-authored on my ORCiD and down below.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/publications/","section":"Publications","summary":"","title":"Publications"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"Rojo-Carrillo, J.

BMC genomics, 25(1), 1148.\nDOI: 10.1186/s12864-024-11017-3\nBackground\nProtein-coding genes have been considered the functional part of the genome, although they represent only 2% of the genome. In contrast, more than 90% of the genome produces non-coding RNA (ncRNA), including antisense (AS) genes, a type of long non-coding genes (encoding transcripts \u0026gt; 200 nucleotides) located on the opposite strand of coding genes. Therefore, antisense RNA (asRNA) can be complementary to the counterpart sense RNA, supporting a regulatory role with potential pathogenic consequences, as their deregulation has been associated with cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes.\nResults\nWe performed an in-depth review of AS genes in Ensembl and evaluated the expression of AS genes in human liver by third-generation RNA sequencing methods. Currently, 1656 AS genes overlapping with 1556 sense genes have been identified in the human genome. Coding genes with antisense counterparts were significantly larger and had higher transcriptional activity than genes without antisense counterparts. RNA nanopore sequencing of 15 human livers identified 185 transcripts (55 novel) from 150 known AS genes, and 1316 transcripts from 807 sense genes, with 111 sense-antisense pairs. Sense transcripts showed higher expression than antisense transcripts. Remarkably, RNA nanopore sequencing of human livers identified 146 transcripts (67 novel) corresponding to 118 possible novel AS genes.\nConclusion\nThis study reveals the landscape of AS genes in the human genome and demonstrates the power of long-read RNA sequencing to identify novel transcripts and even novel AS genes, exploring the relationship between sense and AS gene expression as well.\n","date":"27 November 2024","permalink":"/publications/2024-11-27/","section":"Publications","summary":"","title":"Landscape of antisense genes in the human genome and identification of new human hepatic antisense RNAs by long-read sequencing"},{"content":"Garrido-Rodríguez, P., Carmena-Bargueño, M., de la Morena-Barrio, M.

Mutations affecting serpins may disturb their conformation, leading to inactive forms. Unfortunately, conformational consequences of serpin mutations are difficult to predict. In this study, we integrate experimental data of patients with mutations affecting one serpin with the predictions obtained by AlphaFold and molecular dynamics. Five SERPINC1 mutations causing antithrombin deficiency, the strongest congenital thrombophilia were selected from a cohort of 350 unrelated patients based on functional, biochemical, and crystallographic evidence supporting a folding defect. AlphaFold gave an accurate prediction for the wild-type structure. However, it also produced native structures for all variants, regardless of complexity or conformational consequences in vivo. Similarly, molecular dynamics of up to 1000 ns at temperatures causing conformational transitions did not show significant changes in the native structure of wild-type and variants. In conclusion, AlphaFold and molecular dynamics force predictions into the native conformation at conditions with experimental evidence supporting a conformational change to other structures. It is necessary to improve predictive strategies for serpins that consider the conformational sensitivity of these molecules.\n","date":"5 July 2024","permalink":"/publications/2024-07-05/","section":"Publications","summary":"","title":"Analysis of AlphaFold and molecular dynamics structure predictions of mutations in serpins"},{"content":"Bravo‐Perez, C., Cifuentes‐Riquelme, R., Padilla, J., de la Morena‐Barrio, M.

The whole is greater than the sum of its parts: Long‐read sequencing for solving clinical problems in haematology. Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, 28(3), e17961.\nDOi: 10.1111/jcmm.17961\nStructural variations (SVs) are common in haematological neoplasms. Although most SVs have canonical breakpoints, virtually all have atypical rearrangements that can be of difficult diagnosis. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) has improved the study of atypical SVs, complementing cytogenetics. However, the short reads (\u0026lt;150 bp) generated by HTS might lead to inaccurate mapping. This may not suppose a mere technical pitfall, but a problem to be faced, to guarantee the monitoring and guided-treatment of patients bearing atypical SVs when standard procedures are ‘blind’ to them.\nInversion of chromosome 16, inv(16)(p13q22)/t(16;16)(p13;q22), found in 5%–7% of de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), joins CBFB (16q22) and MYH11 (16p13) genes to form a chimeric oncoprotein that sequesters RUNX1. Up to 95% of cases with AML-inv(16) carry three recurrent breakpoints involving CBFB exon5, and MYH11 exon33, exon29 or exon28, resulting in type A, D or E transcripts, respectively.3 To the best of our knowledge, at least 10 additional CBFB::MYH11 transcripts with non-canonical breakpoints have been reported (Table 1). However, direct characterization of inv(16) at the genomic level has rarely been performed. In this context, third-generation HTS based on long reads, such as nanopore sequencing, could be excellent tools for the identification and comprehensive analysis of atypical SVs.\n","date":"23 January 2024","permalink":"/publications/2024-01-23/","section":"Publications","summary":"","title":"The whole is greater than the sum of its parts: Long-read sequencing for solving clinical problems in haematology"},{"content":"Zamora-Cánovas, A., de la Morena-Barrio, B., Marín-Quilez, A., Sierra-Aisa, C., Male, C., Fernández-Mosteirin, N., Trapero-Marugán, M., Padilla, J., Garrido-Rodríguez, P., Sánchez-Fuentes, A., Rodríguez-Alen, A., Gómez-González, PL., Revilla, N., de la Morena-Barrio, ME., Bastida, JM., Corral, J., Rivera, J. \u0026amp; Lozano, ML.

These short-read–based sequencing methods sometimes fail to characterize the genetics of the disease.\nObjectives\nTo evaluate nanopore long-read DNA sequencing for characterization of structural variants (SVs) in patients with IPDs.\nMethods\nFour patients with a clinical and laboratory diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) (P1 and P2) and Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome (HPS) (P3 and P4) in whom HTS missed the underlying molecular cause were included. DNA was analyzed by both standard HTS and nanopore sequencing on a MinION device (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) after enrichment of DNA spanning regions covering GT and HPS genes.\nResults\nIn patients with GT, HTS identified only 1 heterozygous ITGB3 splice variant c.2301+1G\u0026gt;C in P2. In patients with HPS, a homozygous deletion in HPS5 was suspected in P3, and 2 heterozygous HPS3 variants, c.2464C\u0026gt;T (p.Arg822∗) and a deletion affecting 2 exons, were reported in P4. Nanopore sequencing revealed a complex SV affecting exons 2 to 6 in ITGB3 (deletion-inversion-duplication) in homozygosity in P1 and compound heterozygosity with the splice variant in P2. In the 2 patients with HPS, nanopore defined the length of the SVs, which were characterized at nucleotide resolution. This allowed the identification of repetitive Alu elements at the breakpoints and the design of specific polymerase chain reactions for family screening.\nConclusion\nThe nanopore technology overcomes the limitations of standard short-read sequencing techniques in SV characterization.

Characterization of genetic defects in F11 is mainly focused on the identification of single-nucleotide variants and small insertion/deletions because they represent up to 99% of the alterations accounting for factor deficiency, with only 3 gross gene defects of structural variants (SVs) having been described.\nObjectives\nTo identify and characterize the SVs affecting F11.\nMethods\nThe study was performed in 93 unrelated subjects with FXI deficiency recruited in Spanish hospitals over a period of 25 years (1997-2022). F11 was analyzed by next-generation sequencing, multiplex ligand probe amplification, and long-read sequencing.\nResults\nOur study identified 30 different genetic variants. Interestingly, we found 3 SVs, all heterozygous: a complex duplication affecting exons 8 and 9, a tandem duplication of exon 14, and a large deletion affecting the whole gene. Nucleotide resolution obtained by long-read sequencing revealed Alu repetitive elements involved in all breakpoints. The large deletion was probably generated de novo in the paternal allele during gametogenesis, and despite affecting 30 additional genes, no syndromic features were described.\nConclusion\nSVs may account for a high proportion of F11 genetic defects implicated in the molecular pathology of congenital FXI deficiency. These SVs, likely caused by a nonallelic homologous recombination involving repetitive elements, are heterogeneous in both type and length and may be de novo. These data support the inclusion of methods to detect SVs in this disorder, with long-read–based methods being the most appropriate because they detect all SVs and achieve adequate nucleotide resolution.\n","date":"18 March 2023","permalink":"/publications/2023-03-18/","section":"Publications","summary":"","title":"Impact of genetic structural variants in factor XI deficiency: identification, accurate characterization, and inferred mechanism by long-read sequencing"},{"content":"Cifuentes, R., Padilla, J., de la Morena-Barrio, M.

MLPA did not detect SVs affecting introns (four cases), and the diagnosis was inaccurate in two cases according to long-range PCR or nanopore sequencing. MLPA was used to detect possible hidden SVs in 61 cases with type I deficiency with single nucleotide variations (SNVs) or small insertion/deletion (INDEL).

In three cases, MLPA gave false-positive results, all diagnosed as deletions of the affected exon: a small INDEL complex, and two SNVs affecting MLPA probes. Our study confirms the utility of MLPA to detect SVs in ATD, but also shows some limitations in detecting intronic SVs.

We performed comprehensive molecular, cellular, and clinical characterization of patients with C-terminal antithrombin variants from a cohort of 444 unrelated individuals with confirmed antithrombin deficiency. We identified 17 patients carrying 12 C-terminal variants, 5 of whom had the p.Arg445Serfs17 deletion. Five missense variants caused qualitative deficiency, and 7, including 4 insertion-deletion variants, induced severe quantitative deficiency, particularly p.Arg445Serfs17 (antithrombin \u0026lt;40%). This +1 frameshift variant had a molecular size similar to that of WT antithrombin but possessed a different C-terminus. Morphologic and cotransfection experiments showed that recombinant p.Arg445Serfs17 was retained at the endoplasmic reticulum and had a dominant-negative effect on WT antithrombin. Characterization of different 1+ frameshift, aberrant C-terminal variants revealed that protein secretion was determined by frameshift site. The introduction of Pro441 in the aberrant C-terminus, shared by 5 efficiently secreted variants, partially rescued p.Arg445Serfs17 secretion. C-terminal antithrombin mutants have notable heterogeneity, related to variant type and localization. Aberrant C-terminal variants caused by 1+ frameshift, with similar size as WT antithrombin, may be secreted or not, depending on frameshift site.

Cancers, 14(13), 3106.\nDOI: 10.3390/cancers14133106\nHepsin is a type II transmembrane serine protease whose deregulation promotes tumor invasion by proteolysis of the pericellular components. In colorectal cancer, the implication of hepsin is unknown. Consequently, we aimed to study the correlations between hepsin expression and different clinical-histopathological variables in 169 patients with localized colorectal cancer and 118 with metastases. Tissue microarrays were produced from samples at diagnosis of primary tumors and stained with an anti-hepsin antibody. Hepsin expression was correlated with clinical-histopathological variables by using the chi-square and Kruskal–Wallis tests, Kaplan–Meier and Aalen–Johansen estimators, and Cox and Fine and Gray multivariate models. In localized cancer patients, high-intensity hepsin staining was associated with reduced 5-year disease-free survival (p-value = 0.16). Medium and high intensity of hepsin expression versus low expression was associated with an increased risk of metastatic relapse (hazard ratio 2.83, p-value = 0.035 and hazard ratio 3.30, p-value = 0.012, respectively), being a better prognostic factor than classic histological variables. Additionally, in patients with localized tumor, 5-year thrombosis cumulative incidence increased with the increment of hepsin expression (p-value = 0.038). Medium and high intensities of hepsin with respect to low intensity were associated with an increase in thrombotic risk (hazard ratio 7.71, p-value = 0.043 and hazard ratio 9.02, p-value = 0.028, respectively). This relationship was independent of previous tumor relapse (p-value = 0.036). Among metastatic patients, low hepsin expression was associated with a low degree of tumor differentiation (p-value \u0026lt; 0.001) and with major metastatic dissemination (p-value = 0.023). Hepsin is a potential thrombotic and metastatic biomarker in patients with localized colorectal cancer.

Biomedicines, 10(1), 148.\nDOI: 10.3390/biomedicines10010148\nAdvanced gastric cancer is one of the most thrombogenic neoplasms. However, genetic mechanisms underlying this complication remain obscure, and the molecular and histological heterogeneity of this neoplasm hinder the identification of thrombotic biomarkers. Therefore, our main objective was to identify genes related to thrombosis regardless of Lauren subtypes. Furthermore, in a secondary exploratory study, we seek to discover thrombosis-associated genes that were specific to each TCGA molecular subtype. We designed a nested case-control study using the cohort of the AGAMENON national advanced gastric cancer registry. Ninety-seven patients were selected—48 with and 49 without venous thromboembolism (using propensity score matching to adjust for confounding factors)—and a differential gene expression array stratified by Lauren histopathological subtypes was carried out in primary tumor samples. For the secondary objective, the aforementioned differential expression analysis was conducted for each TCGA group. Fifteen genes were determined to be associated with thrombosis with the same expression trend in both the intestinal and diffuse subtypes. In thrombotic subjects, CRELD1, KCNH8, CRYGN, MAGEB16, SAA1, ARL11, CCDC169, TRMT61A, RIPPLY3 and PLA2G6 were underexpressed (adjusted-p \u0026lt; 0.05), while PRKD3, MIR5683, SDCBP, EPS8 and CDC45 were overexpressed (adjusted-p \u0026lt; 0.05), and correlated, by logistic regression, with lower or higher thrombotic risk, respectively, in the overall cohort. In each TCGA molecular subtype, we identified a series of genes differentially expressed in thrombosis that appear to be subtype-specific. We have identified several genes associated with venous thromboembolism in advanced gastric cancer that are common to Lauren intestinal and diffuse subtypes. Should these genetic factors be validated in the future, they could be complemented with existing clinical models to bolster the ability to predict thrombotic risk in individuals with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma.\n","date":"11 January 2022","permalink":"/publications/2022-01-11/","section":"Publications","summary":"","title":"Identification of Thrombosis-Related Genes in Patients with Advanced Gastric Cancer: Data from AGAMENON-SEOM Registry"},{"content":"Bravo‐Pérez, C., de la Morena‐Barrio, M.

We have analyzed 444 consecutive, unrelated cases, from 1998 to 2021, with functional results supporting antithrombin deficiency in at least one sample. Plasma antithrombin was evaluated by functional and biochemical methods in at least two samples. SERPINC1 gene was analyzed by sequencing and MPLA. Hypoglycosylation was studied by electrophoresis and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In 260 of 305 cases (85.2%) with constitutive deficiency (activity \u0026lt; 80% in all samples), a SERPINC1 (N = 250), or N-glycosylation defect (N = 10) was observed, while 45 remained undetermined. The other 139 cases had normal antithrombin activity (≥ 80%) in at least one sample, what we called transient deficiency. Sixty-one of these cases (43.9%) had molecular defects: 48 had SERPINC1 variants, with two recurrent mutations (p.Ala416Ser[Cambridge II], N = 15; p.Val30Glu[Dublin], N = 12), and 13 hypoglycosylation. Thrombotic complications occurred in transient deficiency, but were less frequent, latter-onset, and had a higher proportion of arterial events than in constitutive deficiency. Two mechanisms explained transient deficiency: The limitation of functional methods to detect some variants and the influence of external factors on the pathogenic consequences of these mutations. Our study reveals a molecular defect in a significant proportion of cases with transient antithrombin deficiency, and changes the paradigm of thrombophilia, as the pathogenic effect of some mutations might depend on external factors and be present only at certain timepoints. Antithrombin deficiency is underestimated, and molecular screening might be appropriate in cases with fluctuating laboratory findings.\n","date":"20 November 2021","permalink":"/publications/2021-11-20/","section":"Publications","summary":"","title":"Molecular and clinical characterization of transient antithrombin deficiency: A new concept in congenital thrombophilia"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"}]
